# Hostel Room Reservation System

A distributed system is a collection of independent components located on
different machines that share messages with each other in order to achieve
common goals. With design patterns like microservices being adapted by
conglomerates to develop and deploy their monoliths, big data systems using
distributed file systems for data sharding and replication, and cloud/on-premise
distributed databases giving performance enhancements, distributed systems have
been a research topic for quite some time now. In this regard, we plan to
implement a distributed hostel room reservation system that can allow university
students to make hostel room reservation easy and hostel administrators to manage
the college hostels. These two types of clients interact with a distributed server that
models, maintains, and updates hostel rooms while ensuring data consistency,
mutual exclusion, and data synchronization. With the distributed hostel room
reservation system, users will be able to view and reserve rooms from the hostel.
Admins will be able to add or remove rooms and view their availability, as well as,
their current waitlist and reservation list.
